<h1>Console Project</h1>
<p>Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.</p>
<p>Web developers often log messages to the Console to make sure that their JavaScript is working as expected. To log a message, you insert an expression like console.log('Hello, Console!') into your JavaScript. When the browser executes your JavaScript and sees an expression like that, it knows that it's supposed to log the message to the Console.</p>
<p>It can be opened by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+I</p>
<script>
console.log("My first console project");
    var testvariable="Prayank ";
    var variablelastname="Sharma";
    var fullname=testvariable.concat(variablelastname);
    console.log(fullname);
    var x = 5;
    var y = 10;
    var z = x * y;
    console.log(z);
    var x = 2;
    var y = 54;
    var z = x + y;
    console.log(z);
    var x = 10;
    var y = 5;
    var z = x - y;
    console.log(z);
    var x = 60;
    var y = 5;
    var z = x / y;
    console.log(z);
    var z = Math.pow(2, 2);
    console.log(z);
